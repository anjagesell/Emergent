# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      üîß CRITICAL FIX - Notizen Field Error (MongoDB ID Mismatch)
      
      Root Cause Identified:
      - PATCH endpoints were not properly extracting query parameters from URL
      - FastAPI requires explicit Query() declaration for URL query parameters
      - Parameters defaulted to None, causing no updates to occur
      
      Changes Made to /app/backend/server.py:
      1. Added Query import: `from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter, HTTPException, Query`
      
      2. Updated PATCH /api/availability-requests/{request_id}:
         - Added explicit Query parameters: `status_processed: Optional[bool] = Query(None)`
         - Added explicit Query parameters: `notes: Optional[str] = Query(None)`
         - Changed error check from `modified_count` to `matched_count` for better debugging
      
      3. Updated PATCH /api/job-applications/{application_id}:
         - Added explicit Query parameters: `status_processed: Optional[bool] = Query(None)`
         - Added explicit Query parameters: `notes: Optional[str] = Query(None)`
         - Changed error check from `modified_count` to `matched_count` for better debugging
      
      Testing Plan:
      1. Test PATCH endpoint for availability requests (checkbox and notes)
      2. Test PATCH endpoint for job applications (checkbox and notes)
      3. Verify no red error messages appear in frontend
      4. Verify data persists after page refresh
      
      Backend restarted successfully - ready for testing.

      üéâ PATCH ENDPOINTS FIX VERIFIED - Notizen Field Issue RESOLVED!
      
      Comprehensive Testing Results:
      
      ‚úÖ PATCH /api/availability-requests/{id}:
      - Status updates (checkbox): Working perfectly
      - Notes updates: Working with German umlauts (√§√∂√º√ü) and special characters (‚Ç¨@#!üè†)
      - Combined updates: Both parameters can be updated together
      - Data persistence: Changes saved correctly to MongoDB
      - Error handling: Proper 404 for non-existent IDs
      - All 5/5 tests passed
      
      ‚úÖ PATCH /api/job-applications/{id}:
      - Status updates (checkbox): Working perfectly  
      - Notes updates: Working with German umlauts and special characters
      - Combined updates: Both parameters can be updated together
      - Data persistence: Changes saved correctly to MongoDB
      - Error handling: Proper 404 for non-existent IDs
      - All 5/5 tests passed
      
      üîß Additional Fix Applied:
      - Fixed HTTPException handling in both endpoints to prevent 404 errors being returned as 500 errors
      - Added proper exception re-raising for HTTPExceptions
      
      ‚úÖ Character Encoding Verification:
      - German umlauts (√§√∂√º√ü) save and retrieve correctly
      - Special characters (‚Ç¨@#!) work properly
      - Emoji characters (üè†) supported
      - URL encoding/decoding working correctly
      
      The original user-reported "bright red error" when writing in Notizen fields has been completely resolved. Both availability requests and job applications can now have their status_processed and notes fields updated successfully through the PATCH endpoints.
