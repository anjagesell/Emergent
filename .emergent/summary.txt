The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the OCTA full-stack application. Initial tasks involved fixing a critical Notizen field error (MongoDB ID mismatch) and removing SMTP email functionality. A significant portion addressed deployment inconsistencies, where user-reported features (AI Customer Service, Intern toggle) from previous sessions were missing, leading to the AI rebuilding these based on explicit user requirements. The AI successfully implemented two empathetic AI chatbots (Anna & Thomas), a sort toggle in the Admin (formerly Intern) section, and an Origin Story page with highly customized old English stationery styling. The latest major feature, an Appointments calendar system, was partially built, but its styling (mint green tab, grid layout) failed to deploy, indicating a persistent CSS sync issue. The AI's problem-solving strategy was iterative, often involving frontend/backend debugging, local testing, and user feedback loops, highlighting the challenges of maintaining deployment consistency.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a critical deployment synchronization issue related to the Appointments (Termine) calendar within the Admin section. While the backend models and endpoints for appointments are complete, and frontend rendering logic for the mint green Termine folder tab, weekly calendar grid, and navigation is implemented locally, the visual styling is not reflecting on the deployed site. Specifically, the Termine tab is not mint green, and the calendar days lack grid borders and display as a vertical list instead of the intended 3-column grid, despite recent  fixes to ensure data loading on page mount. The user has repeatedly saved and deployed, but the visual discrepancies persist, indicating a deeper problem with how frontend CSS changes are being picked up during deployment. The AI engineer is now investigating this deployment sync issue.
