The AI engineer (Neo) undertook a significant development trajectory for the OCTA full-stack application. Initially, work focused on fixing a critical Notizen field error in the internal administration section, identified as a MongoDB ID mismatch. Concurrently, Text-to-Speech functionality was removed, and user-requested SMTP email integration was canceled and purged from the codebase. The engineer then re-implemented previously lost features: two empathetic AI chatbots (Anna and Thomas) integrated into the header, and a toggle button for sorting entries in the Admin section. A new Die Entstehungsgeschichte page was created with an old English stationery aesthetic, incorporating user-provided story content and transparent logos. The Intern section was visually transformed into Manila file folders with numbered tabs. The most complex feature, an Appointments calendar with a weekly grid and daily pop-ups, was partially implemented, but faced persistent deployment issues where local CSS changes failed to reflect on the live site. This recurring deployment problem was attributed to project context switching caused by the  and required direct debugging of CSS application on the frontend. The trajectory ends with the AI attempting to fix the calendar's styling on the deployed site.

<product_requirements>
The OCTA web platform is a bilingual (German/English) care service application with a focus on professional design, client inquiry management, and staff recruitment. Key features include: branded header with logo, custom slogan, and language flags; a sidebar with 8 service categories (Z1-Z8) and a Stellenangebote (Job Offers) section. Content updates for Betreutes Wohnen (Z7) and Wohlfühlstation (Z8) were implemented, including a memorial. A user-provided video is on the homepage. Inquiry forms (Verfügbarkeit anfragen and Stellenangebote) are present, with the latter featuring a comprehensive application. An Admin (formerly Intern) section provides a password-protected view of submissions in an excel spreadsheet style, now with Status bearbeitet (checkbox), Notizen (text area), and delete functionality. This section was redesigned with Manila file folder tabs and a toggle button for sorting. A Die Entstehungsgeschichte (Origin Story) page with old English stationery styling was added. A new Appointments (Termine) feature with a mint green folder, weekly grid calendar, and planned daily pop-ups for scheduling is under development.

<pending_tasks>
- **Two Projects Issue:** Investigate user's report of seeing Octa-Care and Octa Pflege simultaneously, though this may have been an artifact of the deployment issue with  context switching.
- **Appointments Calendar Styling Fix:** The Termine calendar tab is not mint green, and the calendar grid styling (borders, spacing, multi-column layout on mobile) is not deploying correctly to the live site.
- **Appointments Calendar Phase 2:** Implement the daily popup with hourly time slots, add/delete appointment forms, and display appointments within slots.

<current_work>
The most immediate task is fixing the persistent deployment issue related to the Appointments (Termine) calendar's frontend styling. The user reported that despite multiple saves and deploys, the mint green tab, grid borders, and proper spacing for the calendar days are not appearing on the live site (View Preview) and are crunched/bunched together on mobile. The AI engineer previously identified the problem as a deployment synchronization issue, potentially exacerbated by  causing project context switching. The user expressed extreme frustration regarding credit consumption and lack of visible changes. The AI has acknowledged the issue and is directly investigating and attempting to fix the CSS application for the calendar grid within  to ensure the styles are correctly applied and displayed on all devices. The AI's last action was to check if the CSS for the calendar is present in the file.
