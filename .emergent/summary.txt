The AI engineer (Neo) has been working on the OCTA full-stack application, making significant feature additions, styling improvements, and bug fixes across multiple sessions. Initially, the core task was to fix a critical  field error in the Intern section due to a MongoDB ID mismatch, which was successfully resolved and verified. SMTP email functionality was then completely removed as requested.

A major focus shifted to implementing new features that were reportedly lost from a previous session or newly requested. This included building two AI Customer Service Chatbots (Anna and Thomas) with specific empathetic and functional requirements, and a sorting toggle for the Intern section. The design was iteratively refined based on user feedback, particularly for chatbot placement, sizing, and color.

A new Die Entstehungsgeschichte von OCTA (Origin Story) page was developed with detailed old English stationery paper styling, including ornamental borders, realistic textures, and custom typography, with the user providing and refining the narrative. Further enhancements included updating content, refining logos for transparency, and adjusting language labels.

Most recently, the Intern section was rebranded as Admin and received a new Manila file folder aesthetic with a typewriter font, along with a functional delete capability for entries. The AI engineer is now in the process of building a comprehensive Appointments management system, which includes a mint green calendar tab, a weekly grid view, and is currently focused on developing the daily appointment popup. Challenges involved persistent deployment understanding with the user, frontend/backend integration, and CSS styling.

</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively working on the second phase of the new Appointments (Termine) management system within the Admin section. The system currently features a mint green folder tab for Termine and a visible weekly calendar grid (Monday-Saturday) on the Admin page.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer identified and fixed a bug where the calendar grid was not initially displaying when the Termine tab was active. This was resolved by importing  in  and adding a  hook to call  when the  state changes or when the  is set to 'appointments'. This ensures that appointment data is fetched and the calendar grid is rendered correctly upon navigation to the Termine tab.

The user has confirmed that these changes (including the visible grid calendar) are now reflected after a Save to GitHub and Deploy action. The next immediate step is to build the Phase 2 functionality, which focuses on the interactive daily appointment popup.
