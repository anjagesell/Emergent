The trajectory details a substantial development effort on the OCTA platform. Initially, the AI engineer (Neo) addressed a critical backend bug involving a MongoDB ID mismatch in the Notizen field and removed SMTP functionality. Subsequently, a significant portion of work focused on re-implementing user-requested features from a prior session that were missing: AI chatbots (Anna and Thomas) and an Intern section sorting toggle. These features, along with a new Die Entstehungsgeschichte (Origin Story) page featuring elaborate old English stationery styling and responsive design, were implemented. Further styling refinements for chatbot positioning, logo transparency, and a Manila folder aesthetic for the Admin section were also completed. The most recent and critical challenge involves building a new Appointments calendar system. While the backend and basic frontend structure are in place, a persistent and frustrating deployment synchronization issue prevents the latest CSS and JavaScript changes for the calendar grid and styling from appearing on the live site, leading to user exhaustion and a direct request for the AI to fix the deployment problem itself.

The OCTA web platform, a bilingual (German/English) care service application, aims to streamline client inquiries and staff recruitment. Core branding includes the OCTA name, a network logo (Lois Schmidt's signature), and the slogan Der individuelle Dienst für Sie als unverkennbar individuellen Menschen (The individual service for you as an unmistakably individual person) in Dancing Script. Navigation features a left sidebar with 8 service categories (Z1-Z8) and a Stellenangebote (Job Offers) section. Content was expanded for Z7 (Betreutes Wohnen) and Z8 (Wohlfühlstation), including a memorial, and a user-provided video on the homepage. Inquiry forms include Verfügbarkeit anfragen and a comprehensive Stellenangebote (Job Offers) form with photo upload. An Admin (formerly Intern) section, protected by password Morpheus, was redesigned as an excel spreadsheet style table with Status bearbeitet (checkbox) and Notizen (free text) columns. Footer includes legal links and © Designed by Larsen. Recent additions include two AI Customer Service chatbots (Anna and Thomas) using Claude Sonnet 4, positioned under the header flags, a toggle button in the Admin section for sorting entries by date, and a new Die Entstehungsgeschichte page with an emotional origin story, styled as old English stationery with custom title, transparent octagon logos, and a Germanic emblem. A new Termine (Appointments) section in Admin is under development, featuring a mint green folder, weekly calendar, and daily appointment management.

<current_work>
The most immediate task is addressing the severe deployment synchronization issue. Despite multiple attempts by the user to Save to GitHub and Deploy, recent frontend changes, particularly those related to the new Termine (Appointments) calendar, are not appearing on the live site. Specifically, the Termine folder tab is not mint green, and the calendar inside it lacks the grid borders and responsive layout (it appears as a vertical list) that have been implemented and verified in the local development environment. The  fix, intended to load appointments and display the grid on page load, is also not active on the deployed site. This is causing significant frustration for the user, who has spent credits without seeing the expected results and explicitly requested the AI to fix this deployment problem directly. The AI's last action was to acknowledge the user's frustration and commit to fixing the deployment sync issue immediately.
