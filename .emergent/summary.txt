The previous AI engineer meticulously built a full-stack web application named OCTA in response to iterative user requests, primarily in German. The work started with understanding the existing codebase (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB) and progressed through multiple feature additions. Key developments included structuring the UI with a left-sidebar navigation and 8 service categories, implementing a bilingual (German/English) interface with flag toggles, integrating a custom logo and a background watermark image, adding a contact form with MongoDB storage and planned email functionality, and creating a password-protected internal page to view submissions. Subsequent tasks focused on enhancing content, ensuring responsiveness, adding legal pages (Impressum, DSGVO), incorporating partner logos, and finally, adding a Stellenangebote (Job Offers) section with detailed recruitment text, work-life balance imagery, and an application form. The AI consistently used  and  for modifications and  for image selection. The current work halted mid-way during the Stellenangebote feature implementation, specifically while updating the recruitment text with details about flexible hours and volunteer work, just before the user requested to save. The pending task is the email sending SMTP configuration.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was in the process of enhancing the Stellenangebote (Job Offers) page. Specifically, it had just integrated a Work-Life Balance image and was preparing to add a job application form. The immediate last action, after an  operation to insert these elements, was the user's request to Save. The AI responded by stating it was still *updating the recruitment text* to include details about flexible working hours and volunteer opportunities, indicating that the content was undergoing a final refinement before the work on this page was considered complete. The state suggests the image and form structure are in place, but the descriptive text for the job offers might still be in flux or undergoing final adjustments.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Complete the update of the recruitment text on the Stellenangebote page, incorporating flexible working hours and volunteer options as per the user's last explicit request.
