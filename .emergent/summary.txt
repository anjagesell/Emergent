The AI engineer (Neo) continued developing the OCTA full-stack application. Key feature additions included an iteratively expanded job application form with numerous fields and photo upload, content updates for Betreutes Wohnen and Wohlfühlstation (including a memorial to Andreas and Anna Iris Schmidt), a bilingual slogan, and the embedding of a user-provided video on the homepage. A significant effort was made to transform the Intern section into an excel spreadsheet style table with status and notes fields. Text-to-Speech functionality was implemented for accessibility but later removed. Persistent deployment issues due to local Git sync versus Save to GitHub caused user frustration. The work concluded with the AI troubleshooting a critical backend error related to the Notizen field in the Intern section, indicating a MongoDB document ID mismatch.

<current_work>
The most immediate task being addressed is a critical bug in the Intern section. The user reported an Error in bright red when attempting to write in the Notizen (notes) field for both availability requests and job applications. This error prevents proper internal management. The AI has identified the root cause as a MongoDB document ID field mismatch within the backend's PATCH endpoints, which are failing to locate and update the correct documents in the database. The AI's last action was to begin fixing this issue in . Additionally, the first bullet point mentioning Andreas and Anna in the Wohlfühlstation section has been removed from both German and English versions of the content.
